Guard Core PHP - API Security Core Engine for PHP language

# guard-core-php

Guard Core PHP: the API security core engine for PHP. A framework-agnostic port of the [guard-core](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core) detection engine that powers the PHP adapters: [psr15-guard](https://github.com/rennf93/psr15-guard), [laravel-guard](https://github.com/rennf93/laravel-guard), [symfony-guard](https://github.com/rennf93/symfony-guard), and [slim-guard](https://github.com/rennf93/slim-guard).

Docs: <https://rennf93.github.io/guard-core-php/>

## Install

```bash
composer require rennf93/guard-core-php:^4.0.4
```

Requires PHP `^8.2` with `ext-pcre`, `ext-mbstring`, and `ext-json`. The engine is consumed through the adapter packages or driven directly:

```php
use RenzoFranceschini\GuardCore\Config\SecurityConfig;
use RenzoFranceschini\GuardCore\Engine\GuardEngine;

$config = new SecurityConfig(
    enableRedis: false,
    blacklist: ['192.0.2.0/24'],
    rateLimit: 100,
    rateLimitWindow: 60,
    enableRateLimiting: true,
);

$engine = new GuardEngine($config);
```

## IP lists: whitelist vs exempt_ips

`whitelist` and `exempt_ips` answer different questions. A non-empty `whitelist` is restrictive: every IP not on it is denied by the global IP check. `exempt_ips` is noise reduction for known-friendly automation (monitoring probes, VPN egress, a partner's server): a listed IP or CIDR skips the rate-limit, user-agent and per-route cloud-provider checks, but it is not immunity. The blacklist, dynamic IP bans, the global `block_cloud_providers` list and penetration detection still apply to exempt IPs, the whitelist deny path is unchanged (an exempt IP does not pass a restrictive whitelist it is not on), and an invalid entry fails closed at config construction. Entries accept IPv4, IPv6 and IPv4-mapped forms with the same matching semantics as the whitelist.

```php
$config = new SecurityConfig(
    enableRedis: false,
    exemptIps: ['198.51.100.7', '198.51.100.0/28'],
);

$engine = new GuardEngine($config);
```

## Geo rate limits

Routes can carry per-country rate-limit tiers: `RouteConfig::$geoRateLimits` maps a country code (`'DE'`) or the `'*'` fallback to a `{limit, window}` tier, mirroring the reference engines' `@geo_rate_limit` decorator. Country resolution is pluggable and the tiers only activate when a country resolver is configured on the rate limit handler: **without a resolver the geo tier is inert and the default limit applies** (a route can carry the map, but nothing fires until one is wired). The resolver is a `Closure(string): string` from client ip to country code (empty string when unknown, which takes the `'*'` fallback); adapters wire it after engine construction:

```php
$engine = new GuardEngine($config);
$engine->rateLimitHandler()->setGeoResolver(
    static fn (string $ip): string => $ipinfo->countryOf($ip) // your geo lookup
);

$request->state()->routeConfig = new RouteConfig(
    geoRateLimits: ['DE' => ['limit' => 5, 'window' => 60], '*' => ['limit' => 20, 'window' => 60]],
);
```

A request from a resolved country enforces that country's tier first (`'*'` when the country is missing from the map, nothing when neither matches), the tier shares the route's hashed bucket, and exempt and whitelisted clients still skip the check entirely. Geo country blocking (`blocked_countries`/`whitelist_countries`) remains unsupported.

## Detection limits


### Size-gated pattern family (large single-line subjects)

A family of detection patterns anchored at `\A` walks the subject one character
(or one path segment) at a time: the `etc/passwd`, `boot.ini`, `proc/self/environ`
and `var/log` line walks, the keyword-lookahead double walks, and the anchored
path-walk segment loops for `.htaccess`, `wp-admin`, `.env`, `.git`, recon path
targets and siblings (`PatternData::SIZE_GATED_PATTERN_INDICES`). PCRE2 consumes
stack proportional to the walked line, so on stock php:8.3 ini a benign
single-line subject can exhaust PCRE2 and abort detection entirely:

- `pcre.jit=1` (default): failures from ~24.5KB subjects
  (`PREG_JIT_STACKLIMIT_ERROR`) for the line-walk shapes, and from ~16.4KB for
  the segment-loop shapes once a trailing target follows ~16KB of path
  segments (`a/` repeated is the stack-densest input, floor cliff ~16392
  bytes).
- `pcre.jit=0`: failures from ~100KB subjects (`PREG_RECURSION_LIMIT_ERROR`).

Mitigation: when a view subject's first line reaches
`SusPatterns::GATED_PATTERN_MAX_SUBJECT_BYTES` (15360, 15 KiB), the preg calls
of that family are skipped for the rest of the scan (no match contribution) and
detection completes normally. The threshold sits below the ~16.4KB segment-loop
cliff and above the largest conformance corpus content (14725 bytes), so it
holds under either `pcre.jit` setting (ini-independent) and never changes
conformance behavior.

Coverage trade-off: walk and segment patterns are line-scoped, so skipping
above the gate only forgoes their coverage on very long single-line subjects
(15KB or more in one line). All other patterns still scan the full subject, and
probes in shorter lines or multiline bodies are unaffected.
